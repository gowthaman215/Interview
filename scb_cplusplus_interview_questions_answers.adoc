== Introduction

This document contains a curated list of **commonly asked technical interview questions at Standard Chartered Bank (SCB)** for C++ / systems / e-trading roles, along with **clear and practical answers**.

Focus areas include:
* Modern C++ (C++14/17)
* Multithreading and concurrency
* Memory management
* STL usage and trade-offs
* Low-latency and system design thinking
* Linux and debugging basics

---

== Core C++ Questions

=== What is RAII and why is it important?

RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) binds the lifetime of a resource to the lifetime of an object.

* Resources are acquired in the constructor
* Resources are released in the destructor
* Guarantees no leaks, even during exceptions

[source,cpp]
----
class File {
    std::ofstream f;
public:
    File() : f("data.txt") {}
}; // file automatically closed
----

RAII is fundamental for writing safe and exception-resilient C++ code.

=== Difference between const and constexpr

* `const` means the value cannot be modified
* `constexpr` means the value can be evaluated at compile time

[source,cpp]
----
const int x = runtimeValue();
constexpr int y = 10;
----

`constexpr` enables compile-time computation and better optimization.

=== Explain Rule of 3 / 5 / 0

If a class manages resources, it must define:

* Rule of 3: destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment
* Rule of 5: + move constructor, move assignment
* Rule of 0: use RAII types so no custom management is needed

Rule of 0 is preferred in modern C++.

== STL and Containers

=== Difference between vector and list

| vector | list |
|------|------|
| Contiguous memory | Non-contiguous |
| Fast random access | No random access |
| Cache friendly | Poor cache locality |
| Insertion costly in middle | Fast insertion |

Trade-off: choose `vector` for performance, `list` for frequent middle insertions.

=== map vs unordered_map

| map | unordered_map |
|----|---------------|
| Ordered | Unordered |
| O(log n) | O(1) average |
| Tree-based | Hash-based |

Trade-off:
* `map` when ordering is required
* `unordered_map` when lookup speed matters
