== Introduction

Boost is one of the most powerful and widely used collections of peer-reviewed, portable C++ libraries that extend the capabilities of the C++ Standard Library.  
It provides support for many programming needs such as memory management, threading, filesystem operations, regular expressions, and more. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Some Boost libraries have been adopted into the C++ Standard Library (for example, smart pointers, threading, and regular expressions), demonstrating Boost’s strong influence on modern C++. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

== Boost::SmartPointers

Boost provides several types of smart pointers that help manage dynamically allocated memory more safely than raw pointers.  
Smart pointers automatically release memory when they go out of scope, helping prevent memory leaks. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

=== Example: boost::shared_ptr

[source,cpp]
----
#include <boost/shared_ptr.hpp>
#include <iostream>

void exampleSharedPtr() {
    boost::shared_ptr<int> sp(new int(10));
    std::cout << "Value: " << *sp << std::endl;
}
----

* `boost::shared_ptr` allows shared ownership of an object.  
* When the last shared pointer to an object is destroyed, the object is automatically deleted. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

== Boost::Thread

Boost.Thread provides portable threading abstractions that allow you to create and manage threads across platforms. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

=== Example: Creating and Joining a Thread

[source,cpp]
----
#include <boost/thread.hpp>
#include <iostream>

void printThread() {
    std::cout << "Thread is running" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    boost::thread t(printThread);
    t.join();
    return 0;
}
----

This example demonstrates basic thread creation and joining with Boost. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

== Boost::Filesystem

Boost.Filesystem simplifies file and directory operations, providing a cross-platform interface for path manipulation and file system queries. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

=== Example: Check if a File Exists

[source,cpp]
----
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
#include <iostream>

namespace fs = boost::filesystem;

int main() {
    fs::path path = "/some/path/to/file.txt";

    if (fs::exists(path)) {
        std::cout << "File exists!" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "File not found!" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
----

Boost.Filesystem’s API is intuitive and portable, making filesystem operations easier compared to lower-level APIs. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

== Boost::Regex

Boost.Regex provides a powerful and flexible regular expression library for C++, similar to regex support that was later adopted into the C++ Standard Library. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

=== Example: Regular Expression Search

[source,cpp]
----
#include <boost/regex.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void regexExam
