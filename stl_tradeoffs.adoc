== Introduction

STL trade-offs refer to the conscious decisions made when choosing STL containers, algorithms, and utilities by balancing:

* Performance
* Memory usage
* Predictability
* Safety
* Flexibility

No STL container or algorithm is universally best; each choice involves compromises.

== vector vs list

| Aspect | vector | list |
|------|--------|------|
| Memory layout | Contiguous | Non-contiguous |
| Cache friendliness | Excellent | Poor |
| Random access | O(1) | Not supported |
| Insert/Delete (middle) | O(n) | O(1) |
| Memory overhead | Low | High |

Trade-off:
* `vector` offers speed and cache localit*
